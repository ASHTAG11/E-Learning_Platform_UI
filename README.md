*DESCRIPTION* : LearnFromMe is a modern, front-end–focused e-learning platform built to make online learning feel more immersive, engaging, and user-friendly. The goal of this project is simple: learning should not feel static or overwhelming. Instead, it should guide users naturally through their journey, motivate progress, and create an experience they want to return to.

The platform features a clean multi-page structure including a Dashboard, Courses page, individual Course view, Learning Hub, and a Progress tracker. Users can explore available courses, resume lessons seamlessly, mark content as completed, and visually track their learning progress. Progress and enrollment data are stored using the browser’s localStorage, allowing the platform to maintain user state without relying on a backend.

What sets LearnFromMe apart is its cinematic, Stranger-Things–inspired Halloween theme. The dark interface, glowing accents, subtle animations, and futuristic typography create a focused yet atmospheric environment. Thoughtful hover effects, animated progress bars, interactive cards, and micro-interactions enhance usability while keeping performance lightweight and smooth.

The entire project is developed using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without external frameworks. This highlights a strong foundation in core web technologies, responsive design principles, layout systems, and DOM manipulation. The UI is fully responsive and adapts smoothly across different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

LearnFromMe reflects my approach to front-end development—blending clean structure, meaningful interaction, and visually engaging design. It serves as a strong base that can be extended in the future with features like user authentication, backend integration, real course content, and analytics.
